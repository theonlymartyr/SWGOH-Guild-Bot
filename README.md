3. gac [allycode1] [allycode2] provides a comparison for the GAC matchup of the 2 provided allycodes
4. tw [allycode1] [allycode2] provides a comparison for the TW matchup of the guilds associated with the 2 provided allycodes

# Credits
1. This bot uses the [SWGOH.Help API](https://api.swgoh.help/), you will need to sign up to get an api username and password to put in the config file

2. I also used the [C# wrapper](https://github.com/SdtBarbarossa/SWGOH-Help-Api-C-Sharp) Created By: [SdtBarbarossa](https://github.com/SdtBarbarossa)

3. For Discord Platform I used [This Example](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/Example-Bots/tree/master/DSPlus.Examples.CSharp.Ex03) by [Emzi0767](https://github.com/Emzi0767) to get started.

4. You will need to create a Discord app and get a token to put in the config.json to run this as well: [Here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) is a good walkthrough on that
